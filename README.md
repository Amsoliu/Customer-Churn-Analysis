### Results and Findings

- Overall Churn Rate: A significant portion of customers have churned, highlighting the need for targeted retention efforts.
- Churn by Gender: No major difference in churn rates between male and female customers, implying gender isn't a key churn factor.
- Tenure and Churn: Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn, emphasizing the importance of early engagement.
- Charges and Churn: Higher monthly and annual charges correlate with increased churn, suggesting pricing or perceived value issues.
- Contract Type: Monthly contracts show the highest churn, while two-year contracts have the lowest churn rates, indicating longer contracts reduce churn.
- Payment Method: Customers using electronic checks have higher churn rates, indicating a potential link between payment method convenience and retention.
- Internet Service Type: Fiber optic customers churn the most, while those without internet service churn the least, pointing to possible dissatisfaction with fiber services.
- Additional Services and Churn: Customers using more additional services tend to churn less, showing bundling services can improve retention.

### Recommendations

To reduce churn, it is recommended that the company focus on early engagement strategies, particularly for customers with shorter tenures, offering personalized incentives such as discounts or exclusive services within the first few months. Additionally, revisiting pricing models or offering value-added services for higher-paying customers could help address dissatisfaction linked to cost. Promoting longer-term contracts through loyalty rewards and simplifying payment options, especially by encouraging more convenient methods like credit card or bank transfers, may improve retention. Lastly, enhancing the quality and reliability of fiber optic services could address the high churn rates associated with this service.
